There are two types of variables: shell variables and Python variables. Shell variables are made available to Python scripts as os.environ, a Python dictionary-like object with one entry per variable setting in the shell. Python variables, on the other hand, are used to store values in a program and can be used to save and recall the state of a program."}}}
